We used maven and junit4 in the project, please check when you run the project
All description about our idea, design, and experiment output is in Powerpoint file.

Problem description:
Use genetic algorithm to do the picture generation. Use components (Genes) to consist a picture (Individual, presented by 2D-Array). Store all pictures in a Priority Queue (Population), and let the fittest serval picture survive.

We have three approaches.
* First approach: Picture is presented as (0, 1) 2D-Array. Break down the target image to create Gene pool. Use those genes to create a valid image. 
* Second approach: Picture is presented as (0, 1) 2D-Array. Use random line (Gene) to generate image, the experiment is like drawing a picture using a pencil.
* Third approach: Pictures are presented by RGB value. Use random circle (Gene) to generate image.

What is genetic Algorithm?
In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. John Holland introduced Genetic Algorithm (GA) in 1960 based on the concept of Darwinâ€™s theory of evolution; afterwards, his student Goldberg extended GA in 1989. -- quote from Wikipedia
